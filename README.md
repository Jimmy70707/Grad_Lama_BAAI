# 🤖 AI Health Chatbot

An intelligent, RAG-powered chatbot designed to interpret health sensor readings and provide medically-informed responses in real time.

This chatbot was developed as part of my **graduation project** and contributed to achieving an **A+ grade** in the Electronics & Communication Engineering program at **Helwan University**.

## 🧠 Overview

The AI Health Chatbot leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and Large Language Models to help users understand their medical readings such as ECG, EMG, SpO₂, glucose, and more. It uses an **embedded internal PDF** containing medically verified data to provide fast, accurate, and reliable answers about health metrics, symptoms, and disease indicators.
